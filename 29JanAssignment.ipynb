    "Q 1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Ans. Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum. He began working on Python in the late 1980s, and the first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python for many years and was affectionately known as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) within the Python community until he stepped down from that role in 2018."

    "Q 2.Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "Ans. Python supports several programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative programming: Python allows you to write code in a step-by-step manner, specifying explicit instructions for the computer to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural programming: You can organize your code into reusable procedures or functions, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP): Python has strong support for OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming: Python supports functional programming features such as first-class functions, lambda expressions, and higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aspect-oriented programming (AOP): Although not as native as other paradigms, Python provides libraries and tools that enable aspect-oriented programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's versatility allows developers "

    "Q 3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that variables, function names, class names, and other identifiers must be typed with the exact same casing each time they are used. For example, my_variable, My_Variable, and MY_VARIABLE would be treated as three different identifiers in Python."

    "Q 4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "Ans. The correct extension for a Python file is .py. When you save a Python script, you should give it a filename with the .py extension. For example, script.py. This extension helps identify the file as containing Python code, making it easier for both humans and programs to recognize and work with Python files."

    "Q 5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans. Python code is typically interpreted. When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter reads the source code line by line, parses it, and executes it directly without prior compilation into machine code. This interpretation process occurs at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python does utilize a form of compilation called bytecode compilation. When you run a Python script, the source code is first compiled into bytecode, which is a low-level platform-independent representation of the code. This bytecode is then executed by the Python interpreter. The bytecode compilation happens automatically when you run a Python script or import a module for the first time, and the resulting bytecode is stored in .pyc files to speed up subsequent executions."

    "Q 6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n",
    "Ans. In Python, code blocks are defined using indentation rather than explicit block delimiters like braces ({}) in languages such as C++ or Java. Some common blocks of code in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition Block**: Defines a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parameters. The code block of the function is indented.\n",

    "       print(argument)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if condition:\n",
    "       # Indented code block\n",

    "Q 12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python? \n",
    "Ans. In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier (variable name, function name, class name, etc.) is not explicitly defined by the language specification. However, Python imposes practical limits based on the limitations of the underlying system and the performance considerations of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CPython implementation, which is the reference implementation of Python, the maximum length of an identifier is limited by the maximum size of a C string. In CPython, this limit is typically determined by the `PY_SSIZE_T_MAX` constant, which represents the maximum value of a signed size_t type in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, this means that the maximum length of an identifier in Python can vary depending on factors such as the platform, the compiler used to build Python, and other system-specific constraints. However, in most cases, identifiers in Python can be quite long, typically several thousand characters or more, which should be sufficient for most programming needs."

    "Q 14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Memory management in Python is primarily managed by the Python memory manager, which is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory as needed during program execution. Python uses several strategies for memory management, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Counting**: Python uses reference counting to track the number of references to an object. When the reference count drops to zero, meaning there are no more references to the object, Python deallocates the memory associated with that object. Reference counting is a simple and efficient method for managing memory and handling garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Garbage Collection**: In addition to reference counting, Python also employs a garbage collection mechanism to deallocate objects with cyclic references, where two or more objects reference each other in a circular manner, preventing them from being freed by reference counting alone. Python's garbage collector periodically identifies and collects cyclic garbage to reclaim memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Pool**: Python's memory manager maintains a pool of memory blocks for small objects of certain sizes, known as memory arenas. This memory pool reduces the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation by reusing memory blocks within the pool, rather than constantly requesting memory from the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Python uses dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for objects of varying sizes based on their data type and content. The memory manager requests memory from the operating system when needed and manages the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Memory Optimization Techniques**: Python employs various memory optimization techniques, such as object reuse, memory sharing, and memory profiling, to minimize memory usage and improve performance. These techniques help to reduce memory fragmentation and improve the overall efficiency of memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's memory management is designed to be efficient, automatic, and transparent to the programmer, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about low-level memory management details. However, understanding memory management principles can help developers write more efficient and memory-friendly code, especially in applications with high memory requirements."
