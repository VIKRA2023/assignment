    "'r': Read mode. This mode is used for reading the contents of a file. If the file does not exist, an error will be raised.\n",

    "'w': Write mode. This mode is used for writing to a file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a': Append mode. This mode is used for adding new content to the end of a file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x': Exclusive creation mode. This mode is used for creating a new file. If the file already exists, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. This mode is used for working with binary files, such as images or audio files.\n",

It ensures that the file is properly closed after its operations are done, even if an exception occusrs during the process. THe advantage of using with the statement and open() together is that it makes the code cleaner, more readable, and less prone to errors or leaks."
